      <p>This is Ellsharmin Shaqirin. She is kind and so pretty. She is my classmate and my roommate from semester 2 until semester 5. She is very introverted but always part of group assignments. She is very afraid of insects, especially cockroaches.</p>

      <p>Her given name is Siti Najla, but she is called Naj or Najla. I have known her since pre-diploma. We became close accidentally when she moved to a room right in front of mine and we ended up in the same class.</p>

      <p>This is my class when we went out after rehearsing for the SULAM program. It was the first time in semester 5 that the whole class came together. A beautiful memory indeed.</p>

      <p>This was taken during a program at SRIAM. We were served food and drinks. Some tested the microphones and fixed technical issues to ensure everything ran smoothly during the event.</p>

      <img src="images/5.jpg" alt="memories">
      <p>Our photographer did a great job capturing everything as memories. Some friends even came to help even though they were sick. They carried heavy furniture and worked hard to make things happen.</p>

      <img src="images/6.jpg" alt="memories">
      <p>This shows us having fun in the library. We were tired but the program was worth it. It helped us create unforgettable memories and strengthen our teamwork.</p>
