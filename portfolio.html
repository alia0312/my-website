      My favourite food is kampung-style fried rice. I started to love it when my mother first cooked it for me. The spicy taste, fragrant aroma, and crispy anchovies made it unforgettable. Since then, it has become my go-to meal whenever I feel hungry or want something comforting. Nothing beats the taste of my mother's cooking.
